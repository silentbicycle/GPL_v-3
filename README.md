This is the GNU GPL, Version 3, *remixed*.

If you release any software under this license, please let me know!
(Preferably before you do it, so I can dissuade you.)

I'm not sure if the GPL applies to itself, but just in case, I have
installed a copy on your computer. To retrieve it, execute the following
command line:

    cat $(find / -name "COPYING" 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)

If all you get is an error, then your computer is not compatible with
GPL'd software.
